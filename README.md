#ECBFSM: Entity-Controller-Behaviour-Feature State Machine

ECBFSM is a simple and efficient architecture for game development in C#. The acronym ECBFSM represents the key components of this architecture:

Entity: Represents game objects such as players, enemies, items, and environments. Entities are the active elements of the game that interact with each other and the environment.

Controller: Responsible for managing entity behavior. It coordinates interactions between entities and the environment, controlling movement, actions, and player interactions.

Behaviour: Defines entity behavior in different game situations and states. Behaviors may vary depending on context, including reactions to specific events, interactions with other objects, or responses to player commands.

Feature: Refers to specific functionalities of entities or the game itself. This may include entity special abilities, unique gameplay mechanics, or game systems like inventory, combat, or dialogue.

State Machine: Used to manage the different states of entities and the game. Each entity can have its own set of states representing different behaviors and situations, such as movement, attack, defense, and idle.

ECBFSM allows for clear and modular code organization, facilitating game development, maintenance, and expansion. It offers a flexible and scalable approach to implementing complex behaviors and dynamic interactions between game elements.

This project provides a basic implementation of the ECBFSM architecture in C#, designed to serve as a starting point for game and interactive application development.

Additionally, GameComposition, the composition of ECBFSM, will be added.

Feel free to make further adjustments to fit your project's needs.
